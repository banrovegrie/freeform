Hi Claude, we are writing my (Alapan Chaudhuri) thesis (named Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization) is based on the paper @paper/ ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736)) - we will be calling this the "original paper".

We want to make it one of the best thesis ever written.

Refer to @README.md and @CLAUDE.md for reference.

We are currently focussed on writing chapter 9 or @src/chapters/chapter9.tex which is supposed to introduce novel contributions beyond the original paper and building on top of the paper and later work like @citations/guo2025adiabatic.tex (who cite our original paper).

We want to make sure that this chapter is written exceptionally well.

Chapter 9 must be a superset of the experiments (more correct, more robust, more complete, more in depth, accessibility, rigor and presentation). But it depends on novelty and importance to decide which aspects / sections in the chapter to give more space and priority. Nevertheless it has to be a superset. Unless there are very very very strong reasons to do otherwise (based on taste, structure, novelty or voice).

Again, I want to make sure that all the math done is nevertheless complete and robust and correct irrespective of importance to the "section" or "aspect" it attends to.

We will do two phases:

1. Phase 1 is about completeness, correctness, robustness, coverage etc.
2. Phase 2 is about the quality of writing.
