abstract = {A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.}

    abstract = { The k-{\locHam} problem is a natural complete problem for the complexity class \$\QMA\$, the quantum analogue of \$\NP\$. It is similar in spirit to {\sc MAX-k-SAT}, which is \$\NP\$-complete for \$k\geq 2\$. It was known that the problem is \$\QMA\$-complete for any \$k \geq 3\$. On the other hand, 1-{\locHam} is in {\P} and hence not believed to be \$\QMA\$-complete. The complexity of the 2-{\locHam} problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is \$\QMA\$-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with 2-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation. }

abstract = {The design of new quantum algorithms has proven to be an extremely difficult task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of 'quantum state generation'.We first show that any problem in Statistical Zero Knowledge (including eg. discrete log, quadratic residuosity and gap closest vector in a lattice) can be reduced to an instance of the quantum state generation problem. Having shown the generality of the state generation problem, we set the foundations for a new paradigm for quantum state generation. We define 'Adiabatic State Generation' (ASG), which is based on Hamiltonians instead of unitary gates. We develop tools for ASG including a very general method for implementing Hamiltonians (The sparse Hamiltonian lemma), and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps (The jagged adiabatic path lemma). We also prove that ASG is equivalent in power to state generation in the standard quantum model. After setting the foundations for ASG, we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.The ASG approach to quantum algorithms provides intriguing links between quantum computation and many different areas: the analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians in physics, rapidly mixing Markov chains, statistical zero knowledge, and quantum random walks. We hope that these links will bring new insights and methods into quantum algorithms.},

The Hamiltonian that exhibits this speed-up comes from the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph whose vertices are labeled by n-bit strings, and we can view the adiabatic evolution as an efficient O(poly(n))-time quantum algorithm for finding a specific “EXIT” vertex in the graph given the “ENTRANCE” vertex. On the other hand we show that if the graph is given via an adjacency-list oracle, there is no classical algorithm that finds the “EXIT” with probability greater than exp(−nδ) using at most exp(nδ) queries for δ= 1/5 − o(1). Our construction of the graph is somewhat similar to the “welded-trees” construction of Childs et al., but uses additional ideas of Hastings for achieving a spectral gap and a short adiabatic path.},

We will call such Hamiltonians, which are common in the natural world, stoquastic. An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class PostBPP=BPPpath--a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed. This last result also shows that any problem solved by adiabatic quantum computation using stoquastic Hamiltonians is in PostBPP.},

    abstract = { We study several problems related to properties of nonnegative matrices that arise at the boundary between quantum and classical probabilistic computation. Our results are twofold. First, we identify a large class of quantum Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer. These are stoquastic local Hamiltonians with a “frustration-free” ground-state. A Hamiltonian belongs to this class iff it can be represented as \$H=\sum\_{a}H\_{a}\$ where (1) every term \$H\_{a}\$ acts nontrivially on a constant number of qubits, (2) every term \$H\_{a}\$ has real nonpositive off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard basis, and (3) the ground-state of H is a ground-state of every term \$H\_{a}\$. Second, we generalize the Cook–Levin theorem proving NP-completeness of the satisfiability problem to the complexity class MA (Merlin–Arthur games)—a probabilistic analogue of NP. Specifically, we construct a quantum version of the k-SAT problem which we call “stoquastic k-SAT” such that stoquastic k-SAT is contained in MA for any constant k, and any promise problem in MA is Karp-reducible to stoquastic 6-SAT. This result provides the first nontrivial example of a MA-complete promise problem. }

The quantum wave function can sometimes tunnel through significant obstacles. However it can also sometimes get stuck in local minima, even for fairly simple problems. An initial Hamiltonian which insufficiently mixes computational basis states is analogous to a poorly mixing Markov transition rule. We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length. Indeed, we prove that there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close to the ground state energy. Applying the adiabatic theorem therefore takes exponential time, even for this simple problem.},

We describe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm, which implies that the adiabatic computation model and the conventional quantum computation model are polynomially equivalent. Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two‐dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models allows stating the main open problems in quantum computation using well‐studied mathematical objects such as eigenvectors and spectral gaps of sparse matrices. }

abstract = {We consider the adiabatic quantum algorithm for systems with "no sign problem", such as the transverse field Ising model, and analyze the equilibration time for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) on these systems. We ask: if the spectral gap is only inverse polynomially small, will equilibration methods based on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation succeed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing counter-examples. In some examples, the space of configurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a nontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary time to break into disconnected components with only negligible probability outside these components. For the simplest example we give with an abelian fundamental group, QMC does not equilibrate but still solves the optimization problem. More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can occur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other examples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas from topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes. We define gadgets to realize these Hamiltonians as the effective low-energy dynamics of a transverse field Ising model. We present some analytic results on equilibration times which may be of some independent interest in the theory of equilibration of Markov chains. Conversely, we show that a small spectral gap implies slow equilibration at low temperature for some initial conditions and for a natural choice of local QMC updates.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that with an optimally tuned scheduling function, adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) can readily solve a quantum linear system problem (QLSP) with O(κ poly(log (κ ε))) runtime, where κ is the condition number, and ε is the target accuracy. This is near optimal with respect to both κ and ε, and is achieved without relying on complicated amplitude amplification procedures that are difficult to implement. Our method is applicable to general non-Hermitian matrices, and the cost as well as the number of qubits can be reduced when restricted to Hermitian matrices, and further to Hermitian positive definite matrices. The success of the time-optimal AQC implies that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with an optimal control protocol can also achieve the same complexity in terms of the runtime. Numerical results indicate that QAOA can yield the lowest runtime compared to the time-optimal AQC, vanilla AQC, and the recently proposed randomization method.},

In this paper we show that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First we show the completeness of Simple Max Cut (Max Cut with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the Optimal Linear Arrangement problem. We then show that even if the domains of the Node Cover and Directed Hamiltonian Path problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For Graph 3-Colorability, Node Cover, and Undirected Hamiltonian Circuit, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.}

abstract = {We consider a family of unstructured optimization problems, for which we propose a method for constructing analogue, continuous-time (not necessarily adiabatic) quantum algorithms that are faster than their classical counterparts. In this family of problems, which we refer to as ‘scrambled input’ problems, one has to find a minimum-cost configuration of a given integer-valued n-bit black-box function whose input values have been scrambled in some unknown way. Special cases within this set of problems are Grover’s search problem of finding a marked item in an unstructured database, certain random energy models, and the functions of the Deutsch–Josza problem. We consider a couple of examples in detail. In the first, we provide an O(1) deterministic analogue quantum algorithm to solve the seminal problem of Deutsch and Josza, in which one has to determine whether an n-bit boolean function is constant (gives 0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or balanced (returns 0 on half the input states and 1 on the other half). We also study one variant of the random energy model, and show that, as one might expect, its minimum energy configuration can be found quadratically faster with a quantum adiabatic algorithm than with classical algorithms.}

abstract = {A computation in adiabatic quantum computing is implemented by traversing a path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate, achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time required by our method is O(L2/Δ) for constant error probability, where L is the length of the path of eigenstates and Δ is the minimum spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. The dependence of the cost on Δ is optimal. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful for cases where L is much less than the general bound. The complexity of our method has a logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In particular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation.Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that |Per(A)|>=√(n!)poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application.This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.},

In a finite two-dimensional lattice these problems can be solved by algorithms that require a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the lattice. In contrast to this fact, the same problems are shown to belong to the class of NP-hard problems, both in the two-dimensional case within a magnetic field, and in the three-dimensional case. NP-hardness of a problem suggests that it is very unlikely that a polynomial algorithm could exist to solve it.}

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer’s Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.}}

    abstract = { We consider the numerical calculation of several matrix eigenvalue problems which require some manipulation before the standard algorithms may be used. This includes finding the stationary values of a quadratic form subject to linear constraints and determining the eigenvalues of a matrix which is modified by a matrix of rank one. We also consider several inverse eigenvalue problems. This includes the problem of determining the coefficients for the Gauss–Radau and Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rules. In addition, we study several eigenvalue problems which arise in least squares. }

abstract = {One of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is: whether a quantum computer can solve NP-complete problems more efficiently than a classical computer? In 2000, Farhi, et al. (Science, 292(5516):472-476, 2001) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO), a paradigm that directly attacks NP-hard optimization problems. How powerful is AQO? Early on, van Dam and Vazirani claimed that AQO failed (i.e. would take exponential time) for a family of 3SAT instances they constructed. More recently, Altshuler, et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107(28): 12446-12450, 2010) claimed that AQO failed also for random instances of the NP-complete Exact Cover problem. In this paper, we make clear that all these negative results are only for a specific AQO algorithm. We do so by demonstrating different AQO algorithms for the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold. Whether AQO fails or succeeds for solving the NP-complete problems (either the worst case or the average case) requires further investigation. Our AQO algorithms for Exact Cover and 3SAT are based on the polynomial reductions to the NP-complete Maximum-weight Independent Set (MIS) problem.},
