abstract = {An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large,
2n-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We develop
a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness
the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations
to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized
by quantum circuits with a very simple structure - typically using only a constant
number of ancilla qubits - leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors.
We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level,
and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging
from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications.
We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially
improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped
spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally,
we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that with an optimally tuned scheduling function, adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) can readily solve a quantum linear system problem (QLSP) with O(κ poly(log (κ ε))) runtime, where κ is the condition number, and ε is the target accuracy. This is near optimal with respect to both κ and ε, and is achieved without relying on complicated amplitude amplification procedures that are difficult to implement. Our method is applicable to general non-Hermitian matrices, and the cost as well as the number of qubits can be reduced when restricted to Hermitian matrices, and further to Hermitian positive definite matrices. The success of the time-optimal AQC implies that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with an optimal control protocol can also achieve the same complexity in terms of the runtime. Numerical results indicate that QAOA can yield the lowest runtime compared to the time-optimal AQC, vanilla AQC, and the recently proposed randomization method.},

abstract={For ill-conditioned least squares problems, regularization techniques such as Tikhonov regularization are the key ingredients to obtain meaningful solutions, and the determination of the proper regularization parameter is the most difficult step. This paper focuses on the choice of regularization parameter on a quantum computer. We combine the classical L-curve or Hanke--Raus rule with the HHL algorithm and quantum amplitude estimation that compute the regularized solution and the corresponding residual and their norms. When a series of regularization parameters are tested, we then apply Grover's search algorithm to find the best one that gives the meaningful solution. This yields a quadratic speedup in the number of regularization parameters.},

title={Faster quantum ridge regression algorithm for prediction},
journal={International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics},
year={2022},
month={Apr},
day={12},
abstract={In this paper, a quantum algorithm based on ridge regression model is proposed. The proposed quantum algorithm consists of two parts. One is the first quantum sub-algorithm to efficiently generate predictive values for new inputs. The non-sparse Hamiltonian simulation technique is applied to simulate the data matrix that is generally non-sparse. Therefore, there is no need to expand the data matrix into a larger sparse Hermitian matrix, and the predictive results can be obtained without projection operation at the end of the first sub-algorithm, which makes it more feasible. The other is to determine a reasonable regularization parameter. To achieve this goal, the second sub-algorithm is proposed. In the second sub-algorithm, the suitable one is selected from some candidates using phase estimation algorithm and the controlled rotation operation. In this way, the whole training dataset can be calculated in parallel, which greatly reduces the time complexity. In addition, it is shown that the proposed quantum ridge regression algorithms can achieve exponential speedup over the classical counterpart when the rank of the data matrix is low.},

abstract = {We give a classical analogue to Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum recommendation system, previously believed to be one of the strongest candidates for provably exponential speedups in quantum machine learning. Our main result is an algorithm that, given an m \texttimes{} n matrix in a data structure supporting certain ℓ2-norm sampling operations, outputs an ℓ2-norm sample from a rank-k approximation of that matrix in time O(poly(k)log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the quantum algorithm. As a consequence, Kerenidis and Prakash’s algorithm does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical systems, which run in time linear in m and n. The main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate ℓ2-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum superpositions in the classical setting. This correspondence indicates a potentially fruitful framework for formally comparing quantum machine learning algorithms to classical machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {The quantum algorithm by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd solves a system of N linear equations and achieves exponential speedup over classical algorithms under certain conditions. The advantage to the algorithm is that log(N) rather than N registers are required. Given an N x N matrix A and vectors x and b, the quantum algorithm seeks to find x such that Ax = b. By representing vector b as a superposition of quantum states |b>, quantum phase estimation is used to find the corresponding eigenvalues of A. Applying the inverse Fourier transform, we solve for |x> such that |x> = A-1|b>. We model the algorithm using a quantum circuit diagram, with data qubits encoded using the Steane code for fault tolerant quantum phase estimation. Fresh ancilla for error correction are provided using an oracular pipelined ancilla architecture. We then analyze the classical and quantum resources needed for implementation. The significance of this case study is to examine how classical and quantum resources interact in implementing this algorithm. The issues raised in this analysis, such as fault tolerant phase estimation using pipelined ancilla, garbage collection, and the preparation of I/O registers to this architecture, will be explored in more detail in future research.},

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.}

For more advanced readers, the book discusses topics such as data encoding into quantum states, quantum algorithms and routines for inference and optimisation, as well as the construction and analysis of genuine ``quantum learning models''. A special focus lies on supervised learning, and applications for near-term quantum devices.}
