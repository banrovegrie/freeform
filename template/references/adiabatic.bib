    abstract = { The theory of quantum computational networks is the quantum generalization of the theory of logic circuits used in classical computing machines. Quantum gates are the generalization of classical logic gates. A single type of gate, the universal quantum gate, together with quantum ‘unit wires’, is adequate for constructing networks with any possible quantum computational property. }

    abstract = { Traditional simulated annealing uses thermal fluctuations for convergence in optimization problems. Quantum tunneling provides a different mechanism for moving between states, with the potential for reduced time scales. Thermal and quantum annealing are compared in a model disordered magnet, where the effects of quantum mechanics can be tuned by varying an applied magnetic field. The results indicate that quantum annealing hastens convergence to the optimum state. }

    abstract = { There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods. }

    abstract = { Quantum machines offer the possibility of performing certain computations much faster than their classical counterparts. However, how to define and measure quantum speedup is a topic of debate. Rønnow et al. describe methods for fairly evaluating the difference in computational power between classical and quantum processors. They define various types of quantum speedup and consider quantum processors that are designed to solve a specific class of problems. Science, this issue p. 420 What makes a quantum machine quantum? The development of small-scale quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and detect quantum speedup. Here, we show how to define and measure quantum speedup and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake such a speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from tests run on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. By using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we found no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtained inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the quantum speedup question. }

    abstract = { A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems. }

This method is related to simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyse the method on the Random Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyse and discuss the conditions under which the method has optimal performances.}
