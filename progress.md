# Progress Log: Adiabatic Quantum Optimization Thesis

## Session 1: 2026-02-03

### Accomplished:
- [x] Initial project setup and understanding
- [x] Analyzed IIIT Hyderabad LaTeX template structure
- [x] Fetched paper abstract from arXiv:2411.05736
- [x] Identified existing relevant content in template
- [x] Created planning files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)

### Key Discoveries:
1. Template has useful AQC content in:
   - `chapters/introduction.tex` (adiabatic theorem, definitions)
   - `chapters/annealing.tex` (QUBO, Ising, combinatorial optimization)
   - `references/adiabatic.bib` (22 core references)

2. Paper details:
   - 54 pages, published in Quantum journal (2025)
   - Main result: matches Grover's bound but with #P-hard barrier
   - 7 co-authors

### Blockers:
- Need full paper text for detailed planning
- Need author/advisor information
- Need to clarify timeline

### Next Steps:
1. Get answers to open questions (findings.md)
2. Access full paper content
3. Set up thesis directory structure
4. Begin chapter outline

## Session Notes

### Template Customization Needed:
- [ ] Update titlePage.tex with new title, author, date
- [ ] Rewrite abstract.tex
- [ ] Replace QLSA chapters with AQC content
- [ ] Keep/expand annealing.tex content
- [ ] Add new chapters for paper content and extensions

### Chapter Structure (Draft):
1. Introduction & Motivation
2. Background (QC fundamentals, AQC, Grover's algorithm)
3. Combinatorial Optimization & Ising Models
4. Main Results: Unstructured Adiabatic Optimization
5. The Avoided Crossing Problem (#P-hardness)
6. Numerical Simulations (NEW)
7. Applications & Extensions (NEW)
8. Conclusion & Future Directions
